📑 Credit Memos Portfolio

Hi, I’m Zac Smith — Army veteran, former Goldman Sachs / Citi / Morgan Stanley, and aspiring credit investor.

👋 About Me

I served in the U.S. Army (2013–2017) and transitioned to finance through programs at Goldman Sachs, Citi, and Morgan Stanley.

Afterward, I raised $300K and built a property restoration business that grew past $1M in revenue. When the business entered distress, I led a full restructuring process — including creditor negotiations, asset liquidation, and covenant waivers.

That experience became my real-world MBA in credit investing, giving me firsthand exposure to capital structures under stress and the mechanics of workouts.

I’m currently completing my Finance degree (graduating Dec 2026) and targeting Summer 2026 internships and full-time roles starting early 2027 in:

Buyside: Direct lending, distressed credit, and special situations (e.g. Apollo, Ares, Sixth Street, Oaktree, Blue Owl)

Advisory: Restructuring investment banking (e.g. Evercore, Lazard, Moelis, PJT, Houlihan Lokey)

📝 What You’ll Find Here

This repository features my credit memos and deep-dive analyses on distressed and special situations companies.

I typically publish 2–3 memos per month covering:

Live restructurings

Over-leveraged or stressed businesses

Mispriced credit opportunities

Each memo includes:

📊 Capital structure analysis

💧 Liquidity and cash flow modeling

🧮 Recovery waterfall analysis

🧭 Restructuring scenario planning

📌 Investment recommendation (long / short / avoid) with expected returns

The goal is to demonstrate real credit-investing analytical capability — the kind required for buyside credit and restructuring banking roles.

🤝 Let’s Connect

I’m actively networking with credit professionals and welcome conversations about:

Distressed situations and restructurings

Transitioning from military → finance → entrepreneurship → credit
