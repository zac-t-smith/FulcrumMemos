      "executive_summary_md": "## Executive Summary\n\nThe LYCRA Company faces its second major restructuring in five years, highlighting the fundamental challenge of overleveraging a business with deteriorating end-market demand. Despite previous debt reduction, the company continues to struggle with:\n\n- **Secular headwinds**: Declining demand for traditional stretch fibers in athleisure and intimate apparel markets\n- **Operational stress**: Negative EBITDA trends and persistent cash burn\n- **Capital structure**: Massive debt burden ($1.4B+) relative to depressed enterprise value\n- **Restructuring path**: Pursuing consensual lock-up agreement with creditors to avoid formal Chapter 11\n\n**Investment Conclusion**: The current lock-up proposal appears weighted toward preserving minimal equity value at the expense of secured creditor recoveries. Recovery for senior secured lenders may range 10-30 cents on the dollar, while unsecured and equity likely face near-total losses. Key risk is whether operational improvements materialize or if this represents a terminal decline scenario.\n\n**Recommendation**: Pass on secured debt at current levels; monitor for potential deeply discounted entry post-restructuring if operational stabilization becomes credible.",
      "capital_structure_md": "## Capital Structure\n\nAs of September 2025, LYCRA's approximate capital structure:\n\n| Tranche | Amount | Coupon/Terms | Maturity | Recovery Est. |\n|---------|--------|--------------|----------|---------------|\n| Revolver | $50M drawn | L+500 | 2026 | 60-80% |\n| Term Loan A | $600M | L+550 | 2026 | 15-35% |\n| Second Lien | $400M | 9.50% | 2027 | 0-5% |\n| Unsecured Notes | $350M | 11.00% | 2028 | 0% |\n| Equity | $100M+ (book) | - | - | 0% |\n\n**Total Debt**: ~$1.4B  \n**Enterprise Value (est.)**: $200-400M depending on operational scenario\n\n**Key Intercreditor Issues**:\n- First lien revolver and TLA share collateral but revolver has structural priority\n- Second lien explicitly subordinated with payment blockage provisions\n- Unsecured notes are structurally and contractually subordinated\n\nThe capital structure is severely inverted, with liquidation value estimated at $150-250M (primarily equipment, inventory, and IP) well below total secured debt.",

Unsecured creditors and equity effectively worthless\n\n**Intercreditor Complications**:\n- If TLA lenders can negotiate better treatment via lock-up vs. court process, they have incentive to support deal\n- Second lien holders may threaten to block lock-up to extract nuisance value, but have limited leverage given subordination",
